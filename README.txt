This is a simple netlist parser developed in Java that reads KiCAD netlist file and 
extracts data from it. The PCB is designed in KiCAD and netlist file is generated. 
There are two basic data structures which hold data for the the two distinct 
components comprising the placement task - circuit components and nets.

Components: This class holds data about component name, part or component's 
type and number of pins in each component. An array list for this class holds
all components details.

Nets: This class holds data about net ID, component name and pin number. An 
array list for this class holds all Nets details.

The java program takes only one argument - the netlist file name. This netlist 
file format is generated by KiCAD for a particular PCB design.
